## Project Description
Developed a sentiment analysis system to analyze a dataset of 25,000 movie reviews using Python and machine learning techniques. 
The system provides users with a detailed analysis of the sentiment expressed in the reviews.

### Features
- Performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of 25,000 movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative.
- Offers users a comprehensive analysis of the sentiment expressed in the reviews.

### Implementation Details
- Reads the movie reviews from a dataset and preprocesses them by removing special characters and converting them to lowercase.
- Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features.
- Trains a machine learning model using the preprocessed and vectorized data for sentiment classification.
- Evaluates the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model on a test set.

### Key Achievements
